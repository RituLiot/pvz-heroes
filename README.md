Collection of decks that I've enjoyed playing over the years.

## Time periods
1. Pre-2024: Before the first new balance patch
2. Wormhole Gatekeeper: After QB bugfix, before the FMN/PSF patch

## Acknowledgments
* [Fry Em Up](https://www.youtube.com/@FryEmUpGaming) - the biggest PvZH YouTuber, I frequently borrow their decks for personal use and fun. If you ain't watching him, you're seriously missing out.
* [Flag Zombie](https://www.youtube.com/@flagzombie) - occasionally uploads PvZH content. Not the best deckbuilder, but certainly a one.
* [PvZTryHard](https://www.youtube.com/@PvZTryHard) - I think they're back? Good stuff sometimes.
